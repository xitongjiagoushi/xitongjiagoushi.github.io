Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

**Welcome to my Blog!**

~~~java
@ToString
public class Person {
	@Getter
	private String name;
	@Getter
	private int age;

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
}
~~~


`name`
